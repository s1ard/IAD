# Coin toss

## Difficulty: ![Filled](../resources/star-filled.svg) ![Outlined](../resources/star-outlined.svg) ![Outlined](../resources/star-outlined.svg)

Create algorithms for coin tossing and determine the fairness of these algorithms.

- Before programming, determine a strategy;
  - what datastructure are you going to use?
  - what would be a good algorithm?
- Implement the `tossCoin()` and `tossUnfairCoin()` methods in a manner of your preference. These methods should return 0 if the result of the coin toss is _heads_. Otherwise (_tails_) the return value must be 1.
- Write java code (`CoinMain`) that implements your strategy
  - how fair is your `tossCoin()` method?
  - how fair is your `tossUnfairCoin()` method?
